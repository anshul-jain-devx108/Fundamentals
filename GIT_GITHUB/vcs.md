# Version Control System (VCS)

Version Control System (VCS), also known as source control, is tracking and managing software code changes over time.

# Why we need:
You and your team are building an app. One day you add a new feature and suddenly the app crashes in production. Instead of panicking, you use VCS to go back to yesterday’s working version in seconds. You check the history, see exactly which change caused the issue, fix it in a separate branch, and deploy again—while your teammates keep working without interruption.

# Famous VCS:
1. Git
2. SVN
3. Mercurial

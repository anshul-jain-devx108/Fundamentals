# Types of Cloud Computing" (also referred to as service models) are generally categorized into three layers:

1. **SaaS (Software as a Service)**:  SaaS is a product that is run and managed entirely by the service provider. The user simply utilizes the software without worrying about how the service is maintained or the underlying infrastructure.
    - Target Audience: End users
    - Examples: Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, Salesforce, Dropbox

2. **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**: PaaS provides an environment for the development, deployment, and management of applications. Users do not need to worry about provisioning, configuring, or understanding the hardware or the operating system.
    - Target Audience: Developers
    - Examples: Heroku, Google App Engine, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Azure App Service
    
3.  **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: IaaS provides the fundamental building blocks of cloud IT, IaaS provides access to networking features, computers (virtual or dedicated), and data storage space. It essentially allows you to rent hardware without having to manage the physical data center, IT staff, or hardware maintenance
    - Target Audience: IT Administrators
    - Examples: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

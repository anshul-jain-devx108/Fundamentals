# Types of Cloud Deployment Models

Cloud deployment models determine where your data and applications are stored and how your cloud infrastructure is managed. There are three primary models, plus an emerging fourth model used by large organizations.

1. **Public Cloud**: In this model, everything is built on the cloud provider's infrastructure (e.g., Microsoft Azure). You do not manage any local hardware or data centers; everything runs within the provider's network.
    - Pros: It is generally the most cost-effective option because you avoid upfront hardware costs (CapEx) and only pay for what you use (OpEx). It requires less technical knowledge regarding physical infrastructure, and security controls are strong by default.
    - Cons: You are limited to the configurations offered by the provider, and specific government or regulatory requirements might prevent you from storing certain data publicly

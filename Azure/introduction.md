# Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is the practice of utilizing a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than relying on a local server or personal computer. In this model, a cloud provider owns the physical servers, manages the real estate, and employs the IT staff to maintain the hardware, while the user is responsible for configuring the cloud services and code.

# Key characteristics and benefits of cloud computing include:

- **Cost Effectiveness**: It typically uses a consumption-based model (Pay-As-You-Go), meaning there are no upfront costs, and users only pay for what they use. This shifts spending from Capital Expenditure (CapEx)—buying physical infrastructure upfront—to Operational Expenditure (OpEx), where costs are treated as day-to-day operating expenses.

- **Scalability and Elasticity**: You can increase or decrease resources based on demand. 
    - **Scalability**: refers to the ability to grow, either vertically (adding power to an existing server) or horizontally (adding more servers),. 
    - **Elasticity**: is the ability to automatically scale these resources in response to spikes or drops in traffic.

- **High Availability and Fault Tolerance**: Cloud computing ensures services remain available by removing single points of failure, often by running redundant servers across multiple data centers. It also employs fault tolerance to prevent failure and disaster recovery to prevent data loss.

- **Global Reach**: Users can launch workloads in various regions around the world instantly.   

- **Reliability**: Data backup, data replication, fault tolerance and disaster recovery are built in, ensuring that data is always available and protected from loss.

- **Security**: Cloud providers take care of physical security. Cloud can secure by default or you have ability to configure access down to the granualar level.

- The underlying hardware and managed software is patched, upgraded and maintained by the cloud provider without intertupting the consumer or user.
